       - **Establish these colors for the four vertices  -  We need to create array of vertex colors,then store it into a WebGl Buffer - Then vertex shaders need to updated to pull the appropriate colors from the colorBuffer- Coloring the fragments- We need to look up attribute location for color and set up the attribute for the shader program --- Tell WebGL how to pull out the colors from the color buffer
// into the vertexColor attribute.**
